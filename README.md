# NSF-Workshop-2024-LTE

This repo contains just the implementation for Laplacian Trajectory Editing (LTE) to be used for the workshop. I have added descriptions and instructions to the jupyter notebook in this folder, with the complete code given in the `lte.py` file. The reference for LTE can be found here: https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1238865/905710.pdf
